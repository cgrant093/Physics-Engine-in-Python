This project has been abandoned.

Like the cpp repository on this account with a similar name:
The original project was an imagination of a naive undergraduate thinking he could make a fully functioning physics engine. By fully functioning, I mean uses all known physics out there: Quantum, Classical, E&M, and Stat Mech (and their derivatives)

This was also my way of trying to use/learn python more

I like to keep this here to remind myself of my former ignorance.
